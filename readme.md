## Introduction
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal attributes. The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and is often used for educational purposes. In this project, we use the dataset to train a classification model and make predictions on new unseen data.

## Dataset
The Iris flower dataset contains measurements of four attributes of Iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Along with the attributes, the dataset also provides the corresponding species of each Iris flower sample. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the dataset file is available in the same directory as the code file.
2. Import the required libraries:
   - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data manipulation library for data analysis.
   - [numpy](https://numpy.org/): A library for numerical operations in Python.
   - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): A data visualization library based on matplotlib.
   - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
3. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
4. Explore the dataset by examining the attributes, summary statistics, and visualizations.
5. Preprocess the data if necessary. This step may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, or encoding categorical variables.
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. Train a classification model on the training data.
8. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
9. Make predictions on new unseen data.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements and experiment with different classification models to improve the results.
